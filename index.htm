<h3>Installation instructions</h3>
<p>To run this application, you must first install the npm dependencies with `npm install --save-dev`. 
  Then, you need to create an SQL Database with MySQL, make a copy of `config/config.json.sample` named `config/config.json`, and save the MySQL access information there. 
  You then need to create the tables listed in `config/structure.sql`, and finally run `node genSalt.js` from inside the `config` directory to generate the random salt file. 
  Then, running `npm start` will start the application on `localhost:3021`, which can either be placed behind a separate webserver for distribution or can be accessed 
  locally in a browser.
